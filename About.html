Both inspire me and sometimes give me more ideas. <br> One more thing that inspires me is J.K Rowling. She is an author that inspires me through his writings. <br>The story of her life journey that made her who she is today also inspired me and gave me valuable lessons. <br> <q>Everyone has their own time</q> and I believe that I will have that time when I can become like her.</p>
